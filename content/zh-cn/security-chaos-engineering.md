## 这是什么

Security Chaos Engineering or SCE is a discipline based on [Chaos Engineering](/chaos-engineering/). SCE performs proactive security experimentation on a distributed system to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and malicious conditions. Security chaos engineers use scientific method loops to achieve this, including steady-state, hypothesis, continuous verification, lesson learned, and mitigation implementation.

## Problem it addresses

The main priority for [site reliability engineers](/site-reliability-engineering/) (SREs) and cyber security engineers is to restore service as fast as possible with the goal of achieving zero downtime and minimizing business impact. SREs and cyber security engineers deal both with pre-failure and post-failure incidents situations. Most security issues are challenging to discover and patch quickly, impacting application or system functionality. Additionally, security incidents are usually tricky to uncover during the development phase.

## How it helps

Security Chaos Engineering is built around [observability](/observability/) and cyber resiliency practices. It aims to uncover the "unknown unknowns" and build confidence in the system, increasing cyber resiliency and improving observability.

工程团队将逐步提高对复杂基础设施、平台和分布式系统中安全问题的理解。 SCE 提高了整个产品的网络弹性，发现隐藏的安全问题，暴露经典盲点，并让团队为关键的边缘案例做好准备。这种方法有助于 SRE、 [DevOps](/devops/)和[DevSecOps](/devsecops/)工程师建立对系统的信心，提高网络弹性并提高可观察性。
