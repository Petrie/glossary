## 这是什么

Site Reliability Engineering or SRE is a discipline that combines operations and software engineering. The latter is applied to infrastructure and operations problems, specifically. Meaning, instead of building product features, Site Reliability Engineers build systems to run applications. There are similarities with DevOps, but while DevOps focuses on getting code to production, SRE ensures that code running in production works properly.

## 它解决的问题

确保应用程序可靠运行需要多种功能，从性能监控、警报、调试到故障排除。没有这些，系统操作员只能对问题做出反应，而不是主动努力避免它们——停机只是时间问题。

## 它如何帮助

An SRE approach minimizes the cost, time, and effort of the software development process by continuously improving the underlying system. The system continuously measures and monitors the infrastructure and application components. When something goes wrong, the system points Site Reliability Engineers to when, where, and how to fix it. This approach helps create highly scalable and reliable software systems by automating operational tasks.
