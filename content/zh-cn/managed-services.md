## 是什么

托管服务是一种软件产品，其中运营和管理由第三方负责。例如数据库即服务产品（如 Amazon 的 RDS）或外部监控服务（如 Datadog）。

## 解决的问题

Managing software is complex, especially considering all the different technologies that make up a modern stack. Managing each aspect of it and/or having in-house experts able to do so may be too expensive or not worth your engineers' time. Your team is likely better off building new capabilities than taking care of the operational tasks that can be easily outsourced.

## 提供帮助

Managed services are ready to use from day one with very little operational overhead. They allow organizations to effectively outsource tasks that fall outside of their core competency with well defined, and usually [API](/application-programming-interface/) driven, boundaries.
